Hi {NAME},

My name's Max Wofford and I work for Hack Club, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that helps high schoolers start after-school coding clubs.

We're putting together a high school summer program, Hack Camp (https://camp.hackclub.com), to teach first-time coders how to build websites and games. I saw that you're {RELATION} and I'm reaching out to ask for your help.

We've been getting too many experienced applicants and need help reaching students where we can make the most impact â€“ those who've never written any code before. Could we get a short blurb about Hack Camp in the school bulletin? I've attached it below:

Want to learn to build websites and games? Hack Camp is a two-week summer program designed for high school students with little to no coding experience. We'll bring you from your first line of code to publishing websites and making your first games. It'll run in four two-week sessions throughout the summer.
