Hey %%name%%,

Glad to hear you are interested in mentoring for Hack Camp. Here are the details:

Hack Camp is running from %%camp dates%%, 8:40AM to 6:15PM. If you aren't free the whole day, just give me a heads up what times you are available. We're hosted at [redacted].

If we decide to go forward with you as a mentor, you'll be expected to have the technical knowledge to answer hackers' questions about the workshops. Please familiarize yourself with the content in each workshop before we go over it in camp (https://github.com/hackclub/hackcamp/blob/master/2016/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#list-of-workshops). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions on the curriculum :-).

Let's hop on a quick call so I can get an understanding of your experience and what projects you've built. Are you free %%available time%%?
