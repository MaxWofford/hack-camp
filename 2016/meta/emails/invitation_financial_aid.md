Hi %%name%%,

As mentioned on the phone, I'm very excited to invite you to our %%sessionNumber%% session of Hack Camp, running from %%sessionDates%%.

Hack Camp runs from 9AM to 5:30PM, Monday through Friday. If you can't make it to a day, let a facilitator know in advance â€“ anyone with an unexcused absence will be dropped from the program.

We'll be hosted by Teespring at 448 Bryant Street in San Francisco's SoMa district. The venue is very accessible by public transit (15 minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART/Muni station, 10 minute walk from Caltrain). If you have any questions about getting there or would like to organize a carpool with other campers, let us know and we can put you in touch.

Since we're doing need-based financial aid, we'll need your parents to send us the IRS Form 1040 filed with their most recent tax return by this upcoming Monday (05/30). From there, we'll calculate the scholarship we can offer and send you the final form to confirm your spot. If you have any questions, I've CCed Zach, the executive director of Hack Club (the nonprofit organizing Hack Camp).

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out! max@hackclub.com is my email and [redacted] is my personal cell. Looking forward to meeting you!
