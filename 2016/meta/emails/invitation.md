Hi %%name%%,

As mentioned on the phone, I'm very excited to invite you to our %%sessionNumber%% session of Hack Camp, running from %%sessionDates%%.

Hack Camp runs from 9AM to 5:30PM, Monday through Friday. If you can't make it to a day, let a facilitator know in advance â€“ anyone with an unexcused absence will be dropped from the program.

We'll be hosted by Teespring at 450 Bryant Street in San Francisco's SoMa district. The venue is very accessible by public transit (15 minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART/Muni station, 10 minute walk from Caltrain). If you have any questions about getting there or would like to organize a carpool with other campers, let us know and we can put you in touch.

Below is a link to your confirmation and payment form. It's unique to you, so make sure to not share the link with anyone!
