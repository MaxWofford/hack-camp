# Energizers

## Evolution Rock Paper Scissors

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30
Source: Andrea
```

Everyone starts off in the “egg” stage and has to act like eggs like being in a squatting position. Every “egg” will find another “egg” to play rock paper scissors with. Play rock paper scissors until someone wins 2 out of 3. The person that wins the rps round will then evolve into the next stage, which is “chicken,” and has to find another “chicken” to play rock paper scissors with. The “losing” person will remain an egg and find other eggs to play rock paper scissors with. The stages are egg to chicken to monkey to human then to divine being. In each stage, the “losing” person will de-evolve into the previous stage or if an egg will remain an egg. So if you lose when you're a chicken, then you become an egg again. Once a person becomes a divine being he/she leaves the game and watches.

Continue until you have a certain number of divine beings agreed upon at the beginning of the game.

For example, assume there are 6 people, and they all default start at the "egg" stage. There will be 3 rounds of rock paper scissors total, so egg1 - egg2, egg3 - egg4, egg5 - egg6. There will then be 3 winners, so chicken1 egg2 egg3 chicken4 egg5 chicken6, for example. Then, there will be 2 rounds going on, since there are an odd number of chickens and eggs: chicken1 - chicken6, egg2 - egg3, while chicken4 and egg5 wait for partners. Then when people lose, an example scenario is: egg1, monkey6, chicken2, egg3, chicken4, and egg5. This continues until there are a specific number of divine beings you decide upon.

## Fortunately, Unfortunately

```
Time: 5-10 minutes
Number: 3-5
```

Break up into groups of an odd number of hackers. The first person will say the first line of a news report. Then, each camper will add a sentence to the story that starts with "Fortunately" or "Unfortunately" (alternating each sentence).

> Today someone fell out of a plane.

> Fortunately, they were skydiving.

> Unfortunately, they forgot to bring a parachute.

> Fortunately, they were over the ocean so the water could break their fall.

> Unfortunately, there were sharks in the ocean.

## Human Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-8 people, group into teams of size 2
- when 9-12 people, group into teams of size 3
- when 13+ people, group into teams of size 4 or 5
```

- Organize the students get into teams.
- Announce that there is no talking in this activity
- Facilitator(s) will call out a random prompt (e.g. iPhone, giraffe, surfboard) and start the 30 second timer.
- Each team tries to represent that the prompt with their bodies in that time.
- At the end of the 30 seconds, everyone will freeze as the facilitator(s) goes around and judges the teams and makes funny and comments.
- "This group is trying really hard not to fall. It really does look like the leaning tower of Pizza. Bonus points on being very angled."
- After observing all the groups, the facilitator announces the winner.
- The facilitator tells the winning team gets to pick, announce, and judge the next round.
- You can repeat this for the duration you want this activity.

## I Love My Neighbor Who

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-35
```

- Get everyone into a circle
- Facilitator starts "in the middle" by filling in “My name is _____. I love my neighbor who _____” with anything that applies to him/her such as “I love my neighbor who dances.” or “I love my neighbor who loves sushi”.
- People whom the statement also applies to have to move and find another spot in the circle.
- The last person trying to find a spot will then become the next person in the middle. He/she will fill in the statement “My name is _____. I love my neighbor who _____”.
- The pattern continues. If someone is in the middle more than once you can have someone who hasn’t been in the middle go in instead so we get to know everyone’s names.
- You can also encourage people to say things that apply to them that they don't think will apply to others. That way, it gets people to share things that they think "could only apply to them" and when they realize when it applies to someone else, bonding happens.

## One Word Radio

```
Time: 15 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-9 people, group into teams of 2 or 3
- when 9+, group into teams no larger than 4
```

- In this activity, teams of people will be taking turns acting as a radio station.
- The first team will stand on one side of the room while everyone else (the audience) comes up with a topic on the news.
- The audience will tell the news team what they have to broadcast.
- The news team must give a news broadcast one word at a time, switching between each person on the team each word.

> a: Today
> b: the
> c: White
> a: House
> b: put
> c: a
> a: ban
> b: on
> c: cookies

## Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: whiteboard and marker
```

One person will think of a topic to draw on the whiteboard while everyone else tries to guess what it is. Whoever guesses right will be the next person to draw on the whiteboard.

## Ronda

```
Materials: 40 card Spanish deck
```

A description of the game and instructions on how to play can be found at https://www.pagat.com/fishing/ronda.html

## Two Truths and a Lie

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: Lots of floor space for running
Number: 6 - 10 people
```

> Ask all players to arrange themselves in a circle. Instruct each player to think of three statements about themselves. Two must be true statements, and one must be false. For each person, he or she shares the three statements (in any order) to the group. The goal of the icebreaker game is to determine which statement is false. The group votes on which one they feel is a lie, and at the end of each round, the person reveals which one was the lie.

## Walking

```
Time: 10-15 minutes
```

Going on a walk is a way to readjust everyone's eyes after programming for hours. Going on a walk around 1 or 2 blocks is also a great time for hackers to converse, ask questions, and learn new things about each other.

## Yes And

```
Time: 10-15 minutes
```

Yes And is an improv game to help hackers get into a brainstorming mindset. The point of the game is to come up with the craziest idea you can. Hackers split into partners and build off each others' sentences, prefixed with "Yes, and...". Make sure to emphasize _there are no bad ideas_.

Facilitators need to start with a live example for this exercise to work. Here is a sample:

> A: Let's create tinder for unicorns.

> B: And it will be super effective, and the unicorn population will increase 1,000 times.

> A: Yes, and there won't be enough food for the unicorns.

> B: Yes, and they'll build a spaceship to search for new planets to colonize!

## Youtube

```
Time: 10-15 minutes
Materials: Phone or computer with internet
```

Here's an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc) of what we watch.

## Zip Zap Zop

```
Time: 4 - 8 minutes
Materials: none
Number: unknown
```

- Spend 15 seconds verbally explaining the game
- Then you want to SHOW the game. Grab 3 people and have to demo it like [this](https://youtu.be/lyWKVGoXKak?t=50s).

## Post-it Charades

```
Time: 5-10 minutes 
Materials: Post it notes, pen
Number: 3+
```

- Have everyone stand in a circle, and have the person standing next to the right of Person A write a word/phrase on a post it note.
- Person A will have a post it on their forehead, with a word/phrase written on it. 
- Everyone else will act out what's on the post it, so that Person A can try to guess what the post it says within 45 seconds.
- Go around the circle and repeat the above until everyone has had a turn to guess. 

# Card Games

## Presidents 

```
Time: 10 minutes 
Materials: Deck(s) of cards
Number: 3+
```

- The objective of Presidents is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. Everyone has an even amount of cards.
- Card order is 3, 4, 5...J, Q, K, A, 2
- The three of spades starts out, and everyone goes clockwise. The next person has to play a card that has a number that is equal or higher than the card before it. For example, 3 of spades -> 3 of hearts -> 4 of hearts
- If two people consecutively play the same number value, the person after both of them gets skipped. 
  - Person A plays a 3, Person B plays a 3, Person C gets skipped, and Person D can play anything equal/higher.

There's a concept called "complete" in this game, and it's best explained with an example: 

Example 1
>Person A plays a 3, and Person B plays a 3, and Person C happens to have 2 3's. 
>Person C can then "complete" the 3's, and the cards can be set off to the side. It is then Person C's turn. 
>You'd think that Person C gets skipped, but anyone from the circle can complete the cards. 

Example 2
>Person A plays a 6, and Person 3 happens to have 3 6's. 
>Person 3 can "complete" the 6's and it will be Person 3's turn. 

Example 3
>Person A plays a 4, Person B plays a 4, Person C gets skipped but has a 4, and Person D plays a 4.
>Person C can jump in and complete the 4's, and it is now Person C's turn.

It's advantageous to be able to complete, since it will be your turn, which will allow you to get more cards.

If you start with one card, everyone after you can only play one card (unless they can complete). Same goes with 2 (called `double`), and 3 (called `triple`) cards. However, if someone has 4 cards from one number, then it's essentially an auto-complete. If they play it, they can take another turn (since they completed).

Examples:
>• Person A plays a 3, Person B has 2 4's, but he can only play one of those 4's, not both.

>• Person A plays 2 5's, Person B has no doubles. Person B cannot play, because he has to play doubles to go on.

>• Person A plays 3 8's, Person B has no triples. Same as above, Person B cannot play on it.

- An important rule (although a bit troll) is that you _cannot_ end on a 2. If that happens, by default, you lose.

## BS

```
Time: 10 minutes 
Materials: Deck(s) of cards
Number: 3+
```

- Objective of this game is to get rid of all your cards. Everyone is dealt an equal amount of cards. 
- The game begins with the ace of spades, and it goes counterclockwise. The next person has to play either a card higher or lower (so a K or 2, in this case). For example, if a 6 is played sometime during the round, the next person can play either a 5 or 7. You can play any amount of cards you want. Taking the previous example, if the person before you plays a 6 and you have 3 5's, you can play all 3 of those. 
- If you don't have the card(s) higher or lower than the previous card, you can lie (hence the name BS). For example, if the previous card was a 4, and you don't have a 3 or 5, you can throw down a 7 and say it was a 5. Just for taunting purposes, you can say "popcorn" after the person after you plays their card.

## Code of conduct

It is extremely important for us that Hack Camp is a safe space for each and every hacker (yes, you are a hacker). That means that it is your job to make sure that you do your best to make this a comfortable space for other people.

# Demos

Demos are a great way to show off what you've been building.

So most people here probably think about demoing in the sense of showing off a polished project. This is NOT that.

Demos in Hack Camp are for showing off what you've got done so far in a project, even if it's not done. They're a great way of getting feedback from viewers and sharing your experience with others. You've just gone through the hard work of making a project in a short amount of time – now it's your chance to show the world how you've progressed and what you've learned.

As part of this, we encourage you present something you failed at as part of your demo. Double points for something you still haven't resolved yet – other campers may have struggled with similar issues and can help you.

Step-by-step instructions for presenting:

1. Start showing your project being used.
2. Talk about how your project works.
3. Something you have failed at (and optionally how you will resolve it).
4. Something you have learned by doing this project.

## Mini Demos

Mini demos are shortened demos that are focused on a single feature or group of features. To demo a feature follow these steps:

1. Show the feature being used.
2. Talk about how it works.
3. Repeat for each of the features being presented.
4. Talk about what you failed at and what you learned by building the feature.

# Feedback Forms

Feedback is being collected by [Howdy](https://howdy.ai/), our lovable Slackbot. Responses will be recorded in the [spreadsheet][hack_camp_spreadsheet] under the 'Feedback' sheet.

[hack_camp_spreadsheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HCh5YtN_Y3JXbIMoiUdv-FgYiPZZD1kGg5QnfbsxiCw/edit#gid=1669794560

# Free form projects

## Brainstorming

There's a few ways to brainstorm. Here's how we run our brainstorms.

Start out with a [Yes And session][yes_and] to lower hackers' inhibitions. Make sure to emphasize _there are no bad ideas_. Brainstorming in groups is most effective when people are not filtering other people's ideas. Rank ideas based on their positive qualities -- try to overlook any part of an idea that sounds "bad". With everyone throwing out ideas so quickly, only ideas with the most positives are going to keep circulating in discussion.

[yes_and]: #yes-and

## Building a prototype

Hackers should start out working with facilitators to define a scope for their project. Find a feature or build that can be hacked together in one day (in time for demos). Facilitators will have to work one-on-one with each hacker to figure out what their personal goals are.

# Using Slack

We've gone ahead and created a Slack for Hack Camp over at https://starthackclub.slack.com to use as a place for communicating with hackers during the camp.

## Asking for help

If a hacker says `@hackcamp` in anywhere besides a PM in the Slack, all of the technical mentors and staff for Hack Camp will be pinged. 

If you'd like to be added/removed from the list, please let [@MaxWofford](https://github.com/MaxWofford) ([@msw](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/@msw/) on Slack) know.

## Howdy

Howdy.ai will be running scheduled tasks with the hackers. Facilitators should add new hackers to each activity when the hackers sign up.

# One-on-ones

One-on-ones between hackers and facilitators are a way of getting personalized feedback about camp and curriculum. A hacker and facilitator break off from the group and have a personal chat about how the hacker is doing. It's recommended to follow the same format as [Hack Club's one-on-ones](https://github.com/hackclub/meta/blob/master/meetings/2015-06-16_one_on_ones.m)

# Hack Cheer

Gather everyone in a circle anywhere nearby in the hackerspace, have everyone put their hands in, and on three, all yell "Hack!"
