# Energizers

## Evolution Rock Paper Scissors

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30
Source: Andrea
```

Everyone starts off in the “egg” stage and has to act like eggs like being in a
squatting position. Every “egg” will find another “egg” to play rock paper
scissors with. Play rock paper scissors until someone wins 2 out of 3. The
person that wins the rps round will then evolve into the next stage, which is
“chicken,” and has to find another “chicken” to play rock paper scissors with.
The “losing” person will remain an egg and find other eggs to play rock paper
scissors with. The stages are egg to chicken to monkey to human then to divine
being. In each stage, the “losing” person will de-evolve into the previous
stage or if an egg will remain an egg. So if you lose when you're a chicken,
then you become an egg again.  Once a person becomes a divine being he/she
leaves the game and watches.
Continue until you have a certain number of divine beings agreed upon at the
beginning of the game.

For example, assume there are 6 people, and they all default start at the
"egg" stage.  There will be 3 rounds of rock paper scissors total, so
egg1 - egg2, egg3 - egg4, egg5 - egg6.  There will then be 3 winners, so
chicken1 egg2 egg3 chicken4 egg5 chicken6, for example.  Then, there will
be 2 rounds going on, since there are an odd number of chickens and eggs:
chicken1 - chicken6, egg2 - egg3, while chicken4 and egg5 wait for partners.
Then when people lose, an example scenario is: egg1, monkey6, chicken2,
egg3, chicken4, and egg5.  This continues until there are a specific number
of divine beings you decide upon.

## I Love My Neighbor Who

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-35
```

- Get everyone into a circle
- Facilitator starts "in the middle" by filling in “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____” with anything that applies to him/her such as “I love my
  neighbor who dances.” or “I love my neighbor who loves sushi”.
- People whom the statement also applies to have to move and find another spot
  in the circle.
- The last person trying to find a spot will then become the next person in the
  middle. He/she will fill in the statement “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____”.
- The pattern continues. If someone is in the middle more than once you can have
  someone who hasn’t been in the middle go in instead so we get to know
  everyone’s names.
- You can also encourage people to say things that apply to them that they don't
  think will apply to others. That way, it gets people to share things that they
  think "could only apply to them" and when they realize when it applies to
  someone else, bonding happens.

## Where The West Wind Blows

# Introduction talk

Welcome to Hack Camp.

<!-- add content here @MaxWofford--> 

### Code of conduct

It is extremely important for us that Hack Camp is a safe space for each and
every hacker (yes, you are a hacker). That means that it is your job to make
sure that you do your best to make this a comfortable space for other people.

# List of Workshops

| Workshop  | Technologies | 
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | 
| [Personal Website][personal_website]       | HTML & CSS                               |

# Demos

Step-by-step instructions for presenting:

1. Start showing your project being used.
2. Talk about how your project works.
3. Something you have failed at (and optionally how you will resolve it).
4. Something you have learned by doing this project.

# Feedback Forms

At the end of each day we want to collect feedback from the hackers to see what
did/didn't do well and understand how the hackers feel about camp as it
progresses. 

All of the feedback form responses will be put into the appropriate sheet in
https://docs.google.com/a/hackclub.com/spreadsheets/d/1CdCZLincwwsUd_DRQmB6gPecUnn3KN235zEag5bNgDA/edit?usp=drive_web.

# Using Slack

We've gone ahead and created a Slack for Hack Camp over at
https://starthackclub.slack.com to use as a place for communicating with hackers
during the camp.

## Asking for help

If a hacker says `@hackcamp` in anywhere besides a PM in the Slack, all of
the technical mentors and staff for Hack Camp will be pinged. 

If you'd like to be added/removed from the list, please let
[@MaxWofford](https://github.com/MaxWofford) know.
