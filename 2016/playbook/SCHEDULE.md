# General Overview

Hack Camp is broken up into _workshops_ and _projects_.

- Workshops introduce new concepts
- Projects help solidify the hackers' understanding of introduced concepts



Legend:

- **W** - Workshop
- **P** - Free-form project time
- **D** - Demos
- **MD** - Mini-demos. Shorter demos of work-in-progress. Things aren't expected
  to be finished yet.

Each column indicated the flow of the day. If a row containing **W** is followed
by **F** in the following row in the same column, that means that a workshop
will be followed by project-time that day.

# Days

<!-- 

Before each day, read through the guidelines for each activity. You can find the
guidelines by simply clicking the linked items in the `Activity` column of the
tables.

If the current activity being run is over an hour long, _make an announcement
saying when the next activity will start an hour before the current activity
ends_. For example, if people are currently working on their projects and the
next activity, demos, starts at 4PM, I should make an announcement at 3PM saying
when demos will be.

If the current day is a workshop day, make sure hacker pairs (that work together
in projects) are assigned in some way, shape, or form before brainstorming
starts. You should _assign_ these. Hackers should not be choosing their
partners. Please do make sure to explain _why_ we are assigning hackers.
