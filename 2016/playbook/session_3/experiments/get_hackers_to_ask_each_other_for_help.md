# Get Hackers To Ask Each Other For Help

## Implementation

Mentors will model the behavior by asking other hackers for help when a hacker asks mentors for help.

## Observations

- Each pairing felt awkward.
- May be caused by a lack of knowledge from the hackers.
- People also aren't super comfortable with each other yet.

## Conclusions

- Hackers didn't help out when roped into an issue someone else was stuck on.
- Modeling behavior didn't work this early on in the camp.
