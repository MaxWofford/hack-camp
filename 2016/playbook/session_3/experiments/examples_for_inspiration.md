# Providing better examples to further increase hacker inspiration

## Implementation 

Mentors will find examples for projects students have created from the workshop to increase hacker inspiration.

## Observations 

- People had interesting projects today, and it didn't seem like anyone was blocking on inspiration and/or creativity.
- Saw a lot of people looking at projects that were linked below regardless.

## Conclusion

Unclear whether or not the examples helped hackers with creativity and inspiration, trying experiment again tomorrow to see what happens.
