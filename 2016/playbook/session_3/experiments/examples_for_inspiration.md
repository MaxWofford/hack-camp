# Providing better examples to further increase hacker inspiration

## July 20

### Implementation 

Mentors will find examples for projects students have created from the workshop to increase hacker inspiration.

### Observations 

- People had interesting projects today, and it didn't seem like anyone was blocking on inspiration and/or creativity.
- Saw a lot of people looking at projects that were linked below regardless.

### Conclusion

Unclear whether or not the examples helped hackers with creativity and inspiration, trying experiment again tomorrow to see what happens. 

## July 21

### Implementation

Mentors will find examples for projects students have created from the workshop, or find online projects (ie online games) to increase hacker inspiration.

### Observations

- Most of the examples already provided in the workshop weren't very original, that is, they closely resembled the workshop.
- Many of the hackers didn't have projects that actually deviated from the original Dodge workshop we had, most of it was just different player sprites and enemies. 
- PR with the online game example wasn't merged in, so most of the hackers didn't see the example.  Also, mentors didn't really see too many students looking at the examples. 

### Conclusion

Experiment was inconclusive - it failed based on the implementation - not many extra examples were found, and the example that could've been more helpful was not merged in. However, people didn't seem uninspired by today's workshop - seemed like most people were more into gamedev.
