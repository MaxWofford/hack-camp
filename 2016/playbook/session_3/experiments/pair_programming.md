# Getting hackers to pair program 

## Implementation

During the intro talk before the hackathon, a mentor will suggest that hackers can work on group projects and pair program.

## Observations

- 2 hackers decided to work on a group projects and make a multiplayer game
- They were able to help each other on problems after a mentor got them to sit next to each other
- This helped with getting students to ask each other for help, as we've struggled with that with previous experiments.
- Though it worked out relatively well, demos were not great - one hacker talked way more than the other.

## Conclusions

Pair programming was helpful in getting students to work on projects together and ask each other for help, thus making the experiment successful. The only part that failed a bit was the lack of precedent for equal amounts of talking during demos.
