# Making energizers more inclusive to all

## Implementation 

Mentors will find and run energizers that facilitate teamwork and social interaction. 

## Observations

- Morning energizer was a team drawing game
 - Teams of 2 had to work together: one person was drawing while the other person gave verbal instrutions
 - Much more effective than afternoon game
- Afternoon game was Evolution Rock Paper Scissors
 - Unclear whether or not it facilitated social interaction besides small and frequent rock paper scissors games, it didn't help with any teamwork as each person was individual and was competing against the others 

## Conclusions

- Unclear whether or not it accomplished our goals. Wording of experiment was unclear because inclusive and social are two very different words with different meanings.
