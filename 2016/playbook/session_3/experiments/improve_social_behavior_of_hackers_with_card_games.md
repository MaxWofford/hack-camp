# Running card games during lunch

## Implementation

-Run a card game during lunch which initiates conversation and increases hacker productivity after lunch

## Observations

- Ran 3 rounds of Mafia during lunch

- Certain hackers were left out/felt uninterested in the game due to not having a useful role in the game (e.g. civilian in mafia)

## Conclusions

- Hackers were more social after lunch during hacking time

- Unable to gauge productivity of hackers in afternoon hacking time

- Need to define metrics in future implementations of experiments in order to reach a conclusion
