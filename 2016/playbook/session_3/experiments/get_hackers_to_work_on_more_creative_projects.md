# Get Hackers To Work On More Creative Projects

## Implementation

The primary source of hackers' ideas has been from our workshops. To get hackers to work on original projects, we'll be running a [hackathon](../../ACTIVITIES.md#hackathons) throughout the day. The hackathon will have a central theme, but no example projects.
