# Activities

## Hacker arrival

1. Assign a leader to manage hacker arrival.
2. Have the assigned leader text all of the hackers the morning of with
   something along the lines of the following:

   > Hey Alice! Can't wait to see you this morning. Just as a quick reminder,
   > the address is 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco. Can you shoot me a text
   > or give me a call when you get here?

3. Have the assigned leader wait in the lobby for arriving hackers.
4. When a hacker arrives, have the assigned leader guide them down to the
   hackerspace in the basement, mark their arrival in the
   [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Em5tUQdm4dXnthtWr4zY4KR9Q6JZMV_Hl2n6G9Ti9Bg/edit),
   and then head back up to the lobby to wait for more arriving hackers.

It may be a good idea to play some music in the hackerspace while people are
arriving.

## Meals

### Lunch

On the first day, eat lunch as a large group. On all of the other days, give the
hackers freedom for the entire lunch period.

When eating lunch as a large group, have a designated lunch area and take the
stairs there. If you try and take the elevator, there's a good chance things
will get chaotic, especially with other Galvanize members trying to get to the
first floor with the elevators.
