# Activities

## Hacker arrival

1. Assign a leader to manage hacker arrival.
2. Have the assigned leader text all of the hackers the morning of with
   something along the lines of the following:

   > Hey Alice! Can't wait to see you this morning. Just as a quick reminder,
   > the address is 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco. Can you shoot me a text
   > or give me a call when you get here?

3. Have the assigned leader wait in the lobby for arriving hackers.
4. When a hacker arrives, have the assigned leader guide them down to the
   hackerspace in the basement, mark their arrival in the
   [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Em5tUQdm4dXnthtWr4zY4KR9Q6JZMV_Hl2n6G9Ti9Bg/edit),
   and then head back up to the lobby to wait for more arriving hackers.

It may be a good idea to play some music in the hackerspace while people are
arriving.

## Meals

### Lunch

On the first day, eat lunch as a large group. On all of the other days, give the
hackers freedom for the entire lunch period.

When eating lunch as a large group, have a designated lunch area and take the
stairs there. If you try and take the elevator, there's a good chance things
will get chaotic, especially with other Galvanize members trying to get to the
first floor with the elevators.

## Workshops

### [Portfolio](workshops/portfolio)

#### Prerequisites

- All leaders must complete the workshop

#### Running it

TODO

## Demos

Demos are the hackers' chance to show off what they have been putting so much
time and effort into for the past day.

- Presentation order depends on who volunteers.
- Each team should start off with something they failed at
  - Make sure to give context by explaining the basic overview of the app and
    why this is a failure
- After presenting something they failed at, they can show off what they made

### Giving feedback

Feedback helps hackers improve their presentation and demo skills. To keep demos
running smoothly, feedback is going to be written on sticky notes instead of
shouted out after the demo.

- Pass out sticky notes and pencils/pens to the hackers.
- Have the hackers write the number of the team on the sticky note above their
  feedback (the first team to present is team #1, the second #2, and so on).
- Collect the feedback after demos are over and sort it into groups. Then give
  the feedback to the group it is for.

## Feedback Forms

All of the feedback form responses will be put into the appropriate sheet in
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8y_UB11C4QrXB9kn86-UqVQQqT9FUDqftx1AMHIb3o.
