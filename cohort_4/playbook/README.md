Hack Camp is hackEDU's summer program. It's a two-week program for people who
want to create things with code. We'll bring hackers from their first line of
code to publishing their first project.

The goal of this playbook is to solidify everything needed to run Hack Camp and
make it great.

## Getting Started

The first document you'll want to take a look at is the
schedule (over in [`SCHEDULE.md`](SCHEDULE.md)) (also linked above). It contains a
day-by-day overview of Hack Camp with links for each activity. It also contains
a general overview of Hack Camp's schedule at the top of the file.

Each day, you'll want to read through each activity for the day and get a
general understanding of the day's layout. If there's a workshop happening,
ideally you'd go through it beforehand to get a feel for it.
