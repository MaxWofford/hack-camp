# Understanding Instagram & Building Messenger

In this workshop, we will be looking more in depth at the Instagram workshop
and then building a Messenger app using our knowledge of how we built the
Instagram app.

[See the live demo of the messenger application: ](https://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/50b54d2436ff15679735ca5c8c50d7ee2ff7b744/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/messenger/src/index.html)

## A note on partners

There is a component where you work with your partners for this workshop.
Make sure you know who your partner is for this component (ask a facilitator if)
you're not sure.

## The objectives of this workshop:

- to solidify your understanding of accessing and adding elements
  to an HTML page using JavaScript.
- to practice building a complete project

## Are you already familiar with this?

Some potential challenge projects:

- build a group messaging SMS app
- build a real time chat app that sends you messages over the messaging client
  when you're online and sends you SMS when you're idle or offline
- add firebase to this chat for realtimze syncing

## Understanding the Instagram Workshop

[Here is a live demo](http://output.jsbin.com/cacaqa) of what we built in the
Instagram workshop.

[Here were the instructions](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/0a240456b0f843310ce97b555a78853fcaabecba/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/instagram/README.md) for the Instagram workshop.

We're going to do a deep dive into this application to make sure we understand
how it works. If you're already intimiately famailiar with the code, feel free
to skip the Instagram related section and [go here](#recap) and answer the
questions to make sure you comprehend it.

### Breaking it down

If we were to break down into steps what happens:

- when the page finishes loading
- tell the upload button that whenever someone clicks it
- prompt the user for a URL for the image
- then add a new image
- and add  that new image to the list of existing images already on the page

### Examining the HTML

The HTML only contains two interesting elements:

- the button that you click
- a `<div>` element that you can put photos in

`index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input id="upload-button" type="submit" value="Upload"/>  
    <div id="photos">
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```
Note that you may be less familiar with the `<div>` tag.
Think of the `<div>` tag as an empty box that we can put things in.

It is an element that is used to house other elements in, like our photos.
```

### Adding images to the HTML code

When we add an image, we want to add it into our `<div>` element with the id
`photos`.

In the below examples, I'm going to only show the
`<div>` tag with the `id` of `photos` and hide the rest of the HTML page.

#### Before we add any photos to the `<div>` tag, it is empty:

```html
<div id="photos">
</div>
```

#### Then after we add our first image, the `<div>` tag looks like this

```html
<div id="photos">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BdbsV4F.png">
</div>
```

![](img/1.png)

#### Then after we add our second image:

```html
<div id="photos">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BdbsV4F.png">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/mfAuIRU.png">
</div>
```

![](img/2.png)

#### Then after we add our third image:

```html
<div id="photos">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BdbsV4F.png">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/mfAuIRU.png">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/mukgIPn.png">
</div>
```

![](img/3.png)

### Summary of the Instagram app

The only function of the Instagram app is to add images to the screen inside
of the `<div>` tags. That was the only missing piece that JavaScript needed to
do.

## Examining the JavaScript code of the Instagram app

`main.js`

```js
window.onload = function() {

  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');
  uploadButton.onclick = function() {
    var photoUrl = prompt("Paste a URL of photo to add to the stream!");

    var img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = photoUrl;

    var photos = document.getElementById("photos");
    photos.appendChild(img);
  }
};
```

Let's break down the code into multiple steps:

- waiting for the page to load
- doing something when the button was clicked
- asking the user for a link to an image
- creating an image element
- adding the newly created image element to another element on the page


### Waiting for the page to load

Before we do anything, we needed to wait for the page to load.

To do this, we can put our code inside the `window.onload` function like this:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  // This code inside here runs after the page is finished loading.
  // Any code I write needs to be inside of here.
};
```

### Doing something when the button is clicked

The first thing we need to do is to create a reference to the button in the
HTML.

We can do this by using the function `document.getElementById`.

This function gives us back any element with the id that we give to it as the
input.

We can use this function like this:

```js
document.getElementById('uploadButton');
```

we gave `document.getElementById` the input `'uploadButton'` so it will give us
back the element with the id `'uploadButton'`.

Now because we want to be able to reference this element later, we set a
variable equal to it:

```js
var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');
```

Now we can put this code inside our `window.onload` function like so:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');
  // the variable `uploadButton` now references the upload button element
};
```

```
Pro-tip!

{o,o}
./)_)
  " "

Note that this code would not have worked unless you put it inside the
window.onload function because it would try to find the element before the page
even loaded.
```

Now that we have the reference to the `uploadButton`, I write some code in it's
`onclick` function. The code inside this function will run whenever the button
is clicked:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');

  uploadButton.onclick = function() {
    // this code inside here runs whenever the upload button is clicked
    // any code I want to run when the button is clicked needs to be in here
  }
};
```

### Asking for a link to an image

We need to use `prompt` to ask the user for a URL to an image:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');

  uploadButton.onclick = function() {
    var photoUrl = prompt("Paste a URL of photo to add to the stream!");
    // ^ photoUrl now references the the URL that the user typed into the
    //   prompt box
  }
};
```

### Creating the image element and setting its src attribute

We have a URL to the image we want to display but we don't have an image element
yet so we need to create one.

We can use the `document.createElement` function to create a new HTML element.
here's how we use it:

If we want to create a `<p>` tag, we would write

```js
document.createElement("p");
```

If we want to create an `<img>` tag, we would write

```js
document.createElement("img");
```

And so that we have a reference to the `<img>` tag that is created we write

```js
var img = document.createElement("img");
```

In the above example, the variable `img` references an image tag and currently
looks like this:

```html
<img >
```

Note that it does not have a source attribute yet.

To set the image tag's source attribute, we can do:

```js
var img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = "http://website.com/imge.png";
```

and now the image tag will look like this:

```html
<img src="http://website.com/imge.png">
```

Because we already have a reference to the URL of the image we want
in the `photoUrl` variable, we can do something like this:

```js
var photoUrl = prompt("Paste a URL of photo to add to the stream!");

var img = document.createElement("img"); // creates new image element
img.src = photoUrl;
```

And we only want to run this code when the button is clicked so we put it in the
`uploadButton.onclick` function:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');

  uploadButton.onclick = function() {
    var photoUrl = prompt("Paste a URL of photo to add to the stream!");

    var img = document.createElement("img"); // creates new image element
    img.src = photoUrl;
  }
};
```

### Actually adding the image element to the page

We have successfully created an `<img>` element with the proper `src` property.

However we have not added it to the page yet. The HTML page still looks like this:

```html
<div id="photos">
</div>
```

Now we need to add our image tag inside of `<div id="photos">`.

We can do this by first obtaining a reference to that `<div id="photos">`.

Because our `div` has an id of `photos`, we can use, you guessed it,

```js
var photos = document.getElementById('photos')
```

To add any element inside of any other element, we can use the function:

```js
element1.appendChild(element2);
```
This takes `element2`, and puts it inside of `element1`.

so in our case to add our image element inside of the photos element, we can do:

```js
var photos = document.getElementById("photos");
photos.appendChild(img);
```

Before running the above code:

```html
<div id="photos">
</div>
```

After running the above code:

```html
<div id="photos">
  <img src="http://website.com/imge.png">
</div>
```

Adding this code to everything else, we have:

```js
window.onload = function() {

  var uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');
  uploadButton.onclick = function() {
    var photoUrl = prompt("Paste a URL of photo to add to the stream!");

    var img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = photoUrl;

    var photos = document.getElementById("photos");
    photos.appendChild(img);
  }
};
```

And we're done!

### Recap

And that's all the code that we need to build the Instagram project.

To recap, there were 5 steps:

- waiting for the page to load
- doing something when the button was clicked
- asking the user for a link to an image
- creating an image element
- adding the newly created image element to another element on the page

With your partner, quickly choose who is going to be Person A and who is going
to be Person B.

Then to make sure that you've both mastered the concepts, take turns asking and
answering each others questions. Obviously if one of you is strugging to answer
the question, help them up.

Person A: explain to Person B how the code "waiting for the page to load" section
          works

Person B: explain to Person A how the code in "doing something when the button
          was clicked" section works

Person A: explain the how the code in the "asking the user for a link to an
          image" section works.

Person B: explain how the code in "creating an image element" section works

Person A: explain how the code in "adding the newly created image element to
          another element on the page" section works

Knowing how the Instagram worked, outline in your editor or on a piece of paper
how you may break down the messenger app into smaller pieces?

Feel free to look back at the Instagram code above to see how we broke it down.

## One potential solution for breaking down the messenger app:

- waiting for the page to load
- doing something when the button is clicked
- accessing the value of the new message input
- accessing the value of the username input
- creating the message element with the value of the new message
  and username inputs
- adding the newly created message input to the page

## HTML / CSS walkthrough

For this project, we provided a pre-made HTML & CSS template so that you could
focus on the JavaScript.

Moreover, using our template will give you experience in using existing
written code.

### HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Messenger</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="messenger container">
      <header>Messenger</header>

      <div class='messenger-toolbar'>
        <label for="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input type='text' id='usernameInput' placeholder='enter a username...'>
        <!-- ^ username input-->
      </div>

      <ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
      </ul>
      <!-- ^ list of messages -->

      <footer>
        <input type='text' id='messageInput'  placeholder='Type a message...'>
        <!-- ^ new message input-->
      </footer>

      <button id="submitButton">Send</button>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```

The only 3 items that you need to pay attention to in here are highlighted below

#### the username input
```html
<input type='text' id='usernameInput' placeholder='enter a username...'>
```

#### the message input
```html
<input type='text' id='messageInput'  placeholder='Type a message...'>
```

#### the unordered list that holds the messgages
```html
<ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
</ul>
```

```

If you've never seen the <ul> tag before, go Google it and figure out what is is
and how to use it.

After you've tried Googling and talking to your partner and you're still not
sure, feel free to ask a facilitator.

You'll need to understand this for the rest of the tutorial to make sense.
```

## Appending the messages to the `<ul>` tag

Similar to how we would create and append an `<img>` element and then add it
to the `<div>` element for each new image in the Instagram workshop,
we will create and append a `<li>` and add it to the `<ul>` for each message
sent.

For example, at the very beginning when there are no messages sent, the
`<ul>` element is empty:

```html
<ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
</ul>
```

Then when I send the message,

```
Yo! What's up guys?
```

We'll want to add an `<li>` tag to the `<ul>` like so:

```html
<ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
  <li>Jonathan: Yo! What'up guys?</li>
</ul>
```

![](img/a.png)

Then if I send another message:

```
How are y'all doing?
```

We'll want to add another `<li>` tag

```html
<ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
  <li>Jonathan: Yo! What'up guys?</li>
  <li>Jonathan: How are y'all doing?</li>
</ul>
```

```

## Project Setup Solution

- Create the new folder, `messenger` inside of the root of your **existing**
Cloud9 workspace.
- Inside of the `messenger` folder, create 3 files
  - `index.html`
  - `main.js`
  - `main.css`
- double click to open `index.html`
- In `index.html`, add the HTML base scaffold by typing the following code
  - don't copy and paste it
  - make sure to indent properly

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Messenger</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Now I need to tell `index.html` about my `main.js` file by adding the following
inside of my `head` tag

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
```

and then I need to tell the `index.html` about my `main.css` file by adding the
following inside of my `<head>` tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
```

My HTML file should now look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Messenger</title>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### Ensure LiveReload is running

Make sure that live reload is running by opening a terminal in Cloud9 and typing
`live_reload`. Ask a friend or a facilitator if you don't remember how to do
this.

## Starter Code

The focus of this tutorial is not to learn css or design but to focus on the
manipulation of HTML with JavaScript, that's why we're giving you the starter
code for HTML and CSS.

### So feel free to copy and paste the CSS file into your main.css

```css

  height: 40px;
}
```

### But manually hand-type the below code into your index.html file

We recommend hand typing in this situation because you will be using and
manipulating the HTML lot throughout this project. Hand typing it gives you more
familiarity with the code that you will be manipulating.

Note however, if after you type it out and it still does not work, feel free
to copy and paste at that point because you will have gained the understanding
of the code as you type it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Messenger</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="messenger container">
      <header>Messenger</header>

      <div class='messenger-toolbar'>
        <label for="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input type='text' id='usernameInput' placeholder='enter a username...'>
        <!-- ^ username input-->
      </div>

      <ul id='messageList' class="messenger-messages">
      </ul>
      <!-- ^ list of messages -->

      <footer>
        <input type='text' id='messageInput'  placeholder='Type a message...'>
        <!-- ^ new message input-->
      </footer>

      <button id="submitButton">Send</button>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```

## Now you are ready to try to build the messenger app on your own

We will challenge you to try to implement each step before looking at the
solution.

Here are the list of steps that we are going to follow:

- wait for the page to load
- do something when the button is clicked
- access the value of the new message input
- access the value of the username input
- create the message element with the value of the new message
  and username inputs
- add the newly created message input to the page

Hint: 'Feel free to checkout the section [Doing something when the button is clicked](#doing-something-when-the-button-is-clicked)
in the section above.

## Solution: Do something when the button is clicked

Inside of the `window.onload` function,

- find the `submitButton` using `document.getElementById`
- and create an `onclick` function for the newly found `submitButton`

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

  submitButton.onclick = function() {
    alert("the submit button was clicked");
  }
}
```

## Solution: Access the value of the new message input

- I google `javascript get value of input box`
- I open the
  [first result (a StackOverflow result)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11563638/javascript-get-input-text-value)
- I find the most highly rated solution which gives me

  ```js
  document.getElementById('textbox_id').value;
  ```
- I know that the above code is actually two steps
  1. finding the element by it's id
  2. getting it's value
- So I decide to break up the example into two parts so that it's easier to
  understand

  ```js
  var textBox = document.getElementById('textbox_id');
  var textBoxValue = textBox.value;
  ```
- Now I translate the example to what I need by
  - finding the element with the `id` of `messageInput` instead of `textbox_id`
  - changing the variable names to match

  ```js
  var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
  var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;
  ```
- Great! Now I can add this to my code:
  ```js
  window.onload = function() {
    var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

    submitButton.onclick = function() {
      var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
      var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;
      alert("The new message is " + messageInputValue);
    }
  }
  ```
- Note that I added an `alert` above so that I could see the value of whatever
  was in the message input

In the above code example, when you clicked the button, it would alert whatever
was inside of the message input box.

Your challenge now is to figure out how to make it so that it also alerts
the value of the username input box. So when you click on the button
- it alert the value of the message input box
- and then has a second alert popup with the value of the username box

## Solution: Access the value of the username input

We use the same technique to access the message input as the username input:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

  submitButton.onclick = function() {
    var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
    var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;
    alert("The new message is " + messageInputValue);

    var usernameInput = document.getElementById("usernameInput");
    var usernameInputValue = usernameInput.value;
    alert("The username is " + usernameInputValue);
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet before, we successfully create a reference to the
user's username as well as the text of their new message. We can now create a
new HTML element to add to the page.
```

This code is very similar to the code used in "[Creating the image element and setting its src attribute](#Creating the image element and setting it's src attribute)"

```

Use Google and or review the code in try to figure out how to create a new
`<li>` element.

Hint:
- for the <img> tag, you needed to set the src
- for the `<li>` element, you'll need to set the `innerHTML` property
```

## Solution: Create the message element

- I google for `javascript create an li`
- I see that the second result is "[Javascript to create an li and append to an ol](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9107541/javascript-to-create-an-li-and-append-to-an-ol)"
  almost exactly what I want.
  - I look at the first answer and it looks confusing so I skip it
  - I skip the next answer which has a rating of a `-1`
  - I then go to the third answer and see

    ```js
    document.createElement("li");
    ```
    which jogs my memory back to what I did in
    ["Creating the image element and setting it's src attribute"](#Creating the image element and setting it's src attribute)
- Great, so I now know how to create the `<li>` tag, now to put the text inside
  of the `<li>` tag
- I take the hint to lookup `innerHTML` and google for `javascript innerHTML`
- I see that the first result is
  "[HTML DOM innerHTML Property - W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp)"
  - Looking at the example, it seems that I set the `innerHTML` property like
    this:

    ```js
    element.innerHTML = "some text I want inside the element"
    ```

  - So in order to put the the username and new message text into the `<li>`,
    I can do the following:

    ```js
    var newLi = document.createElement("li");
    newLi.innerHTML = usernameInputValue + " : " + messageInputValue;
    ```
- Putting it all together I get
  ```js
  window.onload = function() {
    var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

    submitButton.onclick = function() {
      var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
      var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;
      alert("The new message is " + messageInputValue);

      var usernameInput = document.getElementById("usernameInput");
      var usernameInputValue = usernameInput.value;
      alert("The username is " + usernameInputValue);

      var newLi = document.createElement("li");
      newLi.innerHTML = usernameInputValue + " : " + messageInputValue;
    }
  }
  ```

## Solution: Adding the newly created message input to the page

You can checkout "[Actually adding the image element to the page](#Actually adding the image element to the page)" for an explanation:

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

  submitButton.onclick = function() {
    var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
    var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;
    alert("The new message is " + messageInputValue);

    var usernameInput = document.getElementById("usernameInput");
    var usernameInputValue = usernameInput.value;
    alert("The username is " + usernameInputValue);

    var newLi = document.createElement("li");
    newLi.innerHTML = usernameInputValue + " : " + messageInputValue;

    var messageList = document.getElementById("messageList");
    messageList.appendChild(newLi);
  }
}
```

And then removing the `alert` messages

```js
window.onload = function() {
  var submitButton = document.getElementById("submitButton");

  submitButton.onclick = function() {
    var messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
    var messageInputValue = messageInput.value;

    var usernameInput = document.getElementById("usernameInput");
    var usernameInputValue = usernameInput.value;

    var newLi = document.createElement("li");
    newLi.innerHTML = usernameInputValue + " : " + messageInputValue;

    var messageList = document.getElementById("messageList");
    messageList.appendChild(newLi);
  }
}
```
