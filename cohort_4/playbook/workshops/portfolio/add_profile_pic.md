  - Great! Last bit of content - let's link to our Facebook profile. You're
    welcome to link to something else though!
  - Links in HTML are created with the `a` tag. We need to set the `href`
    attribute to say where the link should go.

  - Let's go ahead and add a link to our Facebook right under our profile
    image. Replace {url} with a link to your Facebook profile.

    ```html
    <p>
      <a href="{url}">Facebook</a>
    </p>
    ```

  - Notice how we put the `a` tag inside of a `p` tag. The `p` tag means
    paragraph - anything we put inside of it is considered to be part of a
    paragraph.
