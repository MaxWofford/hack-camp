#Challenge: Using margins to adjust elements

What we have: 
>![](img/font.png)

Right now, the image is too high up.  There isn't much space between the top of the webpage and the top of the picture. We want the picture on the page to be moved slightly downwards.  You can achieve this through the use of **margins**.

Try to move the picture downwards using margins.

IMPORTANT: To save time and to limit frustration, spend 3 minutes trying figure out how to do this. If you haven't found what you wanted after 3 minutes just advance to the next page and we'll walk you through it!```
