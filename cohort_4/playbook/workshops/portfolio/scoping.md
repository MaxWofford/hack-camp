# Scoping The Problem

## Scooter Minimal

Say you wanted to build a transportation vehicle that let you travel as quickly as possible across the US. Airplanes are fast—so perhaps building an airplane would be an ideal solution?

Well, building an airplane is really hard. I might first want to try building a car first. Well, even a car may be too hard. Maybe I'd want to build a bike first. Well bikes still have all those complex gear things, maybe I'l build a scooter first.

Cool, I can figure out how to build a scooter. I'm not saying that I'm not going to build a bike, or a car, or an airplane—I just am going to build the scooter first. Once I've had practice my building skills by building a scooter, I then might try my hand at building a bike, and then a car, and then maybe even an airplane!

## Our Scooter

For us, we before we try to build this entire website, let's build everything except the social media section. The entire website without the social media section will still be a fully functional website.

## Building the Scooter

Even when you're building the scooter, you want to make sure you build the foundation of the scooter first before you start to polish the metal of the scooter. The scooter will still work if it's not shiny but it won't without a solid foundation. Don'y polish your scooter first, lay down it's foundations first.

You may notice that the image is too big right now. We can fix this later in the CSS. For now, we want to get all of our "data" into the HTML first. This is laying down the foundation of the scooter first before we start to polish all the metal to make it shiny.
