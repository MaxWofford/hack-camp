#Solution: Using margins to adjust elements
To recap, we want to move the picture downwards, because currently it is too high up.  
##Googling the solution
• I google ```css margin```
> ![](img/margin.png)

• I open the first result: [CSS Margin - W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp)

• It says that: ```The margin clears an area around an element.```  

• We can assume that this margin will be able to clear space at the top of the page, so the picture will be moved downwards.

We see:
> ![](img/marginW3.png)

• We also see that there are four types of margins: top, bottom, right, and left, but since we're only shifting the picture downwards, we can assume we would use ```margin-top```.

So it seems like I add this into the CSS:
```html
margin-top: (someNumber)px;
```
