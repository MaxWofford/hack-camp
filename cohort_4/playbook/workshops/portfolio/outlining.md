## Laying Out the Structure

The first thing that Jonathan personally does when making a website sketching out the structure of the website.

Jonathan does this by making a bulleted point list.

## Example: Laying out Google.com

Let's say Jonathan was trying to rebuild the html of `google.com`

Before he even starts coding, Jonathan lays out the sections of the website

## Google's Main Sections

## Then he will outline it as a bulleted point list

```
- Google
    - Top Navigation Sections
    - Main Search Sections
    - Bottom Navigation Section
```

## Sub Components

Then for each section, he'd add each of the sub-components:
