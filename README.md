# Hack Camp [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/hackedu/hack-camp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hackedu/hack-camp)

Hack Camp is hackEDU's summer program. It's a two-week program for high school
students who want to make things with code. We'll bring participants from their
first line of code to publishing their first project.

## Website

Check out the `gh-pages` branch for Hack Camp's website.

## Objective

The objective of Hack Camp is to simulate a great coding club, where a great
coding club is a community of autonomous hackers building things together. It is
_not_ to figure out how to train others to build great coding clubs.

## Daily Planning

### Modules

Each day is broken up into a series of curricular modules. A module covers a
topic at a certain level of understanding (ex. introduce HTML and CSS
introductory concepts like tags, attributes, and selectors). Modules are
required to have a concrete "deliverable" (ex. a template portfolio website to
show off their projects).

### Day Template

Before every day of Hack Camp, the following template for the day must be
completed:

- Breakfast
- Energizers
- `[INSERT MODULE WITH DELIVERABLE]`
- Demos
- Lunch
- `[INSERT MODULE WITH DELIVERABLE]`
- Demos
- Feedback
