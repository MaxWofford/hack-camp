            Hack Camp is two weeks long and we're running Hack Camp multiple
            times throughout the summer. There are multiple start dates between
            June 1st and August 10th (e.g. June 1st, June 15th, June 29th,
            etc.).

            Where is Hack Camp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp will take place in downtown San Francisco in the heart of
            the city's technology scene. Exact location will be sent to
            applicants upon acceptance.

            Who is it for?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp is for any high school student who wants to learn how to
            create apps, build websites, or make games. We'll be teaching the
            fundamentals of web development, but the skills learned are
            transferable to game development and app development. We welcome
            girls and boys, ages 14-18, no prior experience necessary (though
            young adults with some experience are welcome as well, of
            course). Please bring your own laptop.

            How much does it cost?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp costs $595 for the two-week program. However, inclusivity
            is extremely important to us and we are offering full need-based
            financial aid (see the question on the application form).

            How many other students will be there?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each session of Hack Camp will vary in size between 4 and 12
            students. The student-teacher ratio will vary between nearly 1:1 and
            4:1. For the specifics for a session, please contact us
            at <a href="mailto:summer@hackedu.us">summer@hackedu.us</a>.
