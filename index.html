          Who is Hack Camp for?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hack Camp is for high school students who want to create apps, build
          websites, and make games. Over two exhilarating weeks, you'll learn
          fundamental web development skills transferable to game and app
          development. We welcome anyone ages 14 - 18, no prior experience
          necessary. Young adults with some experience are welcome as well.

          How much does Hack Camp cost?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hack Camp costs $1000 for the two-week program. However, inclusivity
          is extremely important to us and we are readily offering full
          need-based financial aid (see the question on the application form).

            I felt euphoric at the end of each day because I had managed to
            implement a feature I had previously thought impossible to
