# Cohort 3 Preparation

## Objective

In brief:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_To have every participant leave with the mindset and ability as SS._

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reiterate the objective of Hack Camp:

> The objective of Hack Camp is build an set of materials that allows any
> hackEDU team member to reproduce an experience that that brings people from no
> coding knowledge to having the ability, motivation, and confidence to create
> coding projects and continue learning new coding concepts with others, without
> the explicit urging or leading of a teacher.
> 
> This can be broken down into two parts: creating the experience and
> reproducing it.

The full objective of cohort 3:

> The objective of the third cohort is to improve our work from the second
> cohort. We want to do the best job possible satisfying the first part of Hack
> Camp's objective.
> 
> We should be taking personal notes on what we're doing and how we're doing it
> at this stage, but we shouldn't be creating documentation for others to
> reproduce our work yet.

See the README of this repository for the full objective of each cohort.

## Week Layout

- Legend:
  - **W:** Workshop
  - **F:** Free-form (in pairs)
  - **D:** Demos (project conclusions)
  - **MD:** Mini-demos

Each column indicates the flow of the day. If a row containing `W` is followed
by `F` in next row in the same column, that means that during that day, a
workshop will be followed by free-form time.
